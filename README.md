**Tech Stack**: Java
* Arrays for storing ingredients
* Loops and control statements for calculations
* Console-based user interface

**Features**
* Accepts user input for ingredients, measurements, and serving size
* Calculates new ingredient amounts based on desired servings
* Outputs the adjusted recipe to the console
* Menu-driven interface with input validation
